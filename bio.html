        <h3>Early life and education</h3>
        <p>I grew up in Redmond, Washington. I earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Washington. I majored in Communication, Sociology and Swedish, with a minor in Diversity. In the summer of 2015, I studied Swedish abroad with the Uppsala International Summer Session (UISS). While I spent most of my childhood in the city and suburbs, my family got a cabin on Whidbey Island when I was very young and my parents moved there full-time once I went to college.</p>

          <h4>What is the UISS?</h4>
          <p>The Uppsala International Summer Session is a program for students and professionals who are interested in taking intensive Swedish courses during the summer. While Uppsala doesn't have a beach, you're just a short ride to Stockholm where you can explore the archipelago. For more information, you can check out their website <a href="https://uiss.org/">here.</a></p>

        <h3>Professional life</h3>
        <p>After graduating from college, I moved to Whidbey for a short amount of time. However, when I got a job at Brooks Running in Seattle, I moved back into the city. I currently work in the eCommerce department at Brooks.</p>

        <h3>Connection to Whidbey</h3>
        <p>My family has had a house on Whidbey Island for 15 years now. I've experienced the island as a kid, teenager and adult and still find new things to explore each time I visit. I try to get over to the island whenever I can.</p>
